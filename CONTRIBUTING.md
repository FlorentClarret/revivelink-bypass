# Contributing to revivelink-bypass

First off, thank you very much for considering contributing to revivelink-bypass! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Proposing new tools

## Our development process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Contribute to the code

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Pick an issue and leave a comment to tell us that you're willing to work on. We will assign it to you!
2. Create your branch from `master`.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Make sure your code lints. We use pre-commit to ensure this.
7. Issue that pull request!
8. Verify the CI/CD pipeline is green.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/FlorentClarret/revivelink-bypass/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/FlorentClarret/revivelink-bypass/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

Do not hesitate to add as much information as you can.
